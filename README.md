## 🔍 What it does

ProXDefend acts like a lightweight SOC (Security Operations Center) on your local machine. It continuously monitors your system and flags suspicious activity across four key areas:

| Module | What it monitors |
|--------|-----------------|
| 🔄 Process Monitor | Running processes, memory usage, anomalies, crashes |
| 🌐 Network Security | Active connections, traffic anomalies, suspicious sockets |
| 📁 File System | File entropy (detects encryption/ransomware), directory changes |
| 💻 System Health | Uptime, startup locations, system logs |
